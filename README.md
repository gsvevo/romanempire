## Design Process

### Data 
This map is built using the Mapbox street style as the basemap and geodata from the Digital Atlas of the Roman Empire (by Lund University http://dare.ht.lu.se/) for the ancient place names. 

### Style
The style of the map is inspired by that of the Tabula Peutingeriana, the only map of the Roman Empire surviving from antiquity. Both the color scheme and the icons representing the cities derive directly from that model. I created two .svg icons for the two types of placenames (major cities and minor localities).
